        <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Java, Python, Microsoft Word + Powerpoint</li>
        <li>In my 2nd semester I am currently learning how to use: 
        SQL, UML, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <b>Individual Java Programming Project</b>
        <ul>
          <li><i>CSC1025 Procedural Programming</i> included a final java 
          coding project which contained an array of java challenges. This 
          project tested my understanding of things like loops, arrays and 
          text files. One question that required a bit more thinking 
          through was a Caesar Cipher problem.</li>
          <li>I had to split this question into parts in order to find a 
          solution. The first part being able to shift the letters giving 
          down the alphabet by a certain amount, the second was to only do 
          this when the input was a letter and third was for the shift down
          the alphabet to wrap around to the start if required. The third 
          part needed a bit of trial and error but eventually I discovered 
          that by use of the modulus operator I could solve this problem.
          </li>
          <li>This project overall expanded my understanding of the language and allowed me to use my problem solving skills to find solutions to issues I encountered.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Skills Profile</h2>
        <h3>Time Management:</h3>
        <p>As a student of Queen’s University, it is important that I use 
        my time management skills to maintain a balance between my 
        academic work, hobbies and rest. For me it is essential to give 
        adequate time to each aspect of my life whether it be attending 
        lectures and practicals, completing assignments, studying, doing 
        hobbies and resting.</p>

        <h3>Teamwork:</h3>
        <p>The field of computer science is one that requires good 
        communication and teamworking skills. By studying this subject for 
        two years and currently studying the subject at Queen’s University,
        I have developed these skills of working with my peers to solve 
        problems in a professional setting.</p>

        <h3>Communication Skills:</h3>
        <p>Due to my previous work in retail, the collaborative nature of
